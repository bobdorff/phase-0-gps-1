_What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?_
I wasn't necessarily struggling with any concepts, but I had not gotten familiar with `git fetch` and `git merge`. Instead, I relied on git pull to keep everything in sync. 

_What concepts were clarified during the GPS?_
I learned what `git fetch` and `git merge` would be useful for and I got a much better sense for how the GitHub workflow functions when another person is working on the same repo as you. Until this I understood everything conceptually, but getting an email that said someone had added a pull request to one of my repos really drove home how the GitHub system works in practice.

_What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?_
I asked for clarification on the commands I didn't fully understand and I got help early one when I initially cloned my new repo into the wrong directory. My partner and guide helped me realize my error and get everything back on track. 

_What still confuses you about git?_
I'm not really confused by much in git, but it's clear that there's still a lot more to learn. I understand the system, but I'm still figuring out how the different features I know about fit together and create an efficient workflow. The more I work with it, the better I'll grasp its nuances!

_How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?_
Genuinely excellent. I felt supported and I had a great time working through the problems with another person's help. It was less nerve-wracking than I thought. The experience was very confidence inspiring.
