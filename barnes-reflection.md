What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
</p>
Neither one of us were very familiar with fetch and merge since we had always defaulted to pull
requests. And since this was our first pair, we hadn’t yet encountered a merge requests yet. So I
was eager to see how those things could be dealt with.
<p>
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
</p>
In addition to the topics described above, I wasn’t fully aware that branches could be merged
locally. My navigator ended up unknowingly walking me through that process for the first time.
<p>
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
</p>
A lot my communication was clarifying how things should occur. For instance, how the pairing
session will go, what messages we should write, what we’re doing next, what we should discuss, what
commands we should use, etc. My pair did a great job of asking for clarification on topics – for
example, how merge and fetch work and how they correlate to remote vs. local behavior. At times his
curiosity allowed me to sit back and learn from listening – which didn’t bother me. If anything, it
allowed me to focus on the task rather than directing the discussion.
<p>
What still confuses you about git?
</p>
So far I’m feeling pretty good. I think we’ve developed a strong base understanding of Git and
Github. Off the top of my head, I haven’t had to pull down a former commit after flubbing up a
current branch or master. But that’s the sort of problem I feel comfortable dealing with when it
arrives.
<p>
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
</p>
I’m really glad this first pairing had to do with tasks that weren’t too different from what we’ve
already done. It allowed me to get comfortable with the concept pairing with a guide present. If
the problem had been more difficult or stressful, it might have created an associated anxiety with
pairing rather than the problem itself.
